<h1>Explicit Units Style</h1>
<h2>Matlab implementation</h2>
<address>by Ryan Gray<br>

This folder contains a library of small Matlab functions that implement
my
<a href="ExplicitUnitsStyle.html">Explicit
Units Style</a> method. Currently, the units set is not complete, for
example,
liquid units are very lacking.<br>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
Add the 'units' and 'units/si' folders to your Matlab path. You can then use 'units system english' or 'units system cgs' to change to those systems for a session, or you can save your path after issuing one of those commands to always start up in a particular system. Currently, units/si needs to remain on the path - units/english and units/cgs just get moved above it as they use some things in units/si, which is the standard base. In any case, it is recommended that you put the command 'units' in your startup.m file to always remind yourself what units are in use, or you could opt to always assert them in your startup.m with 'units system si', for example just to prevent accidents. The unit systems are explained more later.<br>
<h2>Use:</h2>
Each unit is implemented as a function of the same name or as several
functions for various spellings like feet and foot, etc. Each function evaluates
to a number that amounts to the multiplicative conversion factor from that
unit into the base unit. The current implementation has base units of
meters, kg, seconds, radians. The value of foot is thus 0.3047851. It is actually
defined as <code>0.3047851 * meters</code> in foot.m, but meters is the base,
and so the value of meters (and meter) is 1.0. It is called explicit
because in foot.m, the expression x = <code>0.3047851 * meters </code>is
explicit about what the quantity is. For more detail, see my paper describing this
style.<br>
<br>
Basically, you declare a value to be in particular units by multiplying
and dividing it by the unit function names just as you would write the
value. For example: <code>9.81 * meters / second^2</code><br>
Sure, meters and second have values of 1.0, but it <i>explicitly</i>
states the units the number is in. Moreover, you could combine your code with
a units function library that has different base units, and your code would
work correctly. This is because in a foot-based unit library, the value of
<code>meters</code> is not <code>1.0</code>, but <code>3.281</code>.
Thus, making the quantity have the correct value in that system.<br>
<br>
To print a value in a particular unit, simply divide by the unit or
unit expression you wish to convert it to. For example, if <code>v</code> is velocity,
and you want it in kilometers per second, you would use: <br>
<blockquote><code>v / (km / second)</code><br>
</blockquote>
You might think you could get away with just <br>
<blockquote><code>v / km</code><br>
</blockquote>
but that would break if the base units were hours or if someone thought
they were hours, but mostly it's because using "km/second" reinforces that
this is a speed quantity, and helps with readibility and error checking.
Notice that I did not use:<br>
<blockquote><code>v / km * second</code><br>
</blockquote>
since that is more obscure about the units, and grouping the units with
parenthesis allows you to use one divide or conversion operation to clearly
indicate a unit conversion.<br>
<br>
You could also use unit conversion in code if you needed a value in a
particular unit for some reason. An example could be chopping up a time, 
<code>T</code>, into hours, minutes and seconds:<br>
<blockquote><code>h = floor(T / hours);</code><br>
  <code>m = floor((T - h*hours) / minutes);</code><br>
  <code>s = T - h*hours - m*minutes;</code><br>
  <code></code></blockquote>
I've also used it when I have a subroutine that interfaces with other
code to explicitly declare the units that the values passed in and out have.
The added value is that it both documents what the units in the interface
are and helps assure that my side of the interface passes the correct
units. The units passed are declared in the interface control document, but if
the code needs to be checked, you don't have to look further than the
interface routine to figure out if the units of the variable is what the document
says it should be.<br>
<br>
However, these are all very nice computer scientist thrills, but does
it have a better everyday use? Having it in Matlab, it makes interactive mode
calulations nice. Pull in some numbers from a file that are in feet without
concern of what you are using:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><code>[t x y z] = textread('flyout_in_feet.txt');</code><br>
  <code>t = t * seconds;</code><br>
  <code>pos = [x' * feet; y' * feet; z' * feet];</code><br>
  <code></code></blockquote>
There are genereic unit prefixes defined, so you can compose units that
aren't already there, such as a picometer by using the expression:<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">pico*meter</pre>
Just don't forget when converting to it to use:<br>
<blockquote><code>x / (pico*meter)</code><br>
</blockquote>
to get the right answer. But you could always do this too:<br>
<blockquote><code>pm = pico*meter;</code><br>
  <code>x / pm;</code><br>
  <code></code></blockquote>
Unfortunately, this style does not support shift conversions such as
&deg;C to &deg;F. However, it can do C&deg; to F&deg; with cdeg and fdeg (and
kdeg as well). If you don't know what the difference is, then nevermind.<br>
<h2>Coding Style</h2>
If you are making additions or modifications to the units library, it
is suggested that you follow the existing coding style for consistency.
The basic conventions are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The function should be like following form (for ficticious unit foo in foo.m):</li>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">% Unit foo<br>% Converts number to internal units by multplying by it <br>% Converts number into um by dividing value in internal units by it. <br>% [notes]<br>% See also: bar, bam<br><br>function foo = unit<br><br>foo = bar / bam;</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Aliases to the unit (usually a plural alias) should point back to
the base definition rather than repeat the code of the definition. This
is for simpler maintenance, such as when a bug is found in the
definition, it gets fixed for all dependencies and not just one of
them. For our example, the alias for "foos" would be:<br>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">% Unit foos<br>% Converts number to internal units by multplying by it <br>% Converts number into um by dividing value in internal units by it. <br>% [notes]<br>% See also: foo<br><br>function foos = unit<br><br>foos = foo;<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Notes are optional, but encouraged. They should cite the source
of the conversion factor, but that citation could be in the body of the
function instead. Confusing units are helped by having notes that show
up when asking for help on the unit name.<br>
  </li>
  <li>See also references should at least include any units involved in
the definition of the unit. Other closely related units (esp. ones that
it might be confused for) should also be listed as convenience. For
units that are aliases of another, the 'see also' can just list that
unit rather than repeating all the 'see also's of the unit it is
aliasing.</li>
  <li>Units that are defines in terms of other units might sound good
to use the plural alias of those units, like <code>cup = 8 * ounces</code>,
but for performance, you can avoid the extra overhead of the plural
then calling the defining singular by using the singular in your
definition instead: <code>cup = 8 * ounce</code>.</li>
  <li>Units that are simply scaling prefixes, like kilo, are not really
units, but certainly belong here. However, these declare themselves as
"prefix" rather than "unit" in the function. See "kilo.m" for an
example.</li>
  <li>Unit names should be lower case. Although the standards for unit
names incorporate case sensitivity, it is less practical in this case
since the units are implemented with individual M files. Even though
Matlab is case sensitive, many filesystems are not. Matlab does warn
when you use different case than the M filename, it cannot enforce it
when the filesystem in use is not case sensitive. Also, when typing
them, it is more convenient. A big factor, in my opinion, is to not be
distinguishing between different units merely by letter case. This can
lead to hard-to-spot errors. This means that some units will not appear
proper (<i>e.g.</i>, newton vs. Newton) and others will not be allowed 
(<i>e.g.</i>, mm = millimeter and not megameter, which would be Mm but is less common).<br>
