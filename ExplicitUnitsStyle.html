<h3>Abstract</h3>
Reduce units errors in your code and have an application wide single unit
system while being able to specify constants in different units and easily
read and print them in different units. I don't claim to have invented
this style, but haven't yet seen any other code using doing the same thing.
<h3>Necessity spurs invention</h3>
This evolved during my aerospace engineering under grad senior year back in
1989. We were writing programs that used constants that were given in
all kinds of different units and using equations that required certain numbers
in specific units. In order to manage this chaos, I decided it would
be nice to have the code just using one consistent set of units. However,
the problem of having things that needed certain units made picking the right
set as a base difficult. I began by picking a base units system, then
I converted all the constants into this. Since these were now not easily
recognizable, I put comments after each one showing the value and units that
were familiar. For example:
<pre>float g = 9.81; /* Earth gravity (32.17 ft/s/s) */</pre>
Well, this wasn't perfect, so I changed it to:
<pre>float g = 9.81; /* m/s/s - Earth gravity (32.17 ft/s/s) */</pre>
I thought this was not as readable as I wanted, so I defined m and s to be
unity, and I could get away with placing them in the code next to the number
without changing its value:
<pre>float g = 9.81 * m/s/s; /* Earth gravity (32.17 ft/s/s) */</pre>
<h3>Eureka</h3>
It was then clear that I could define ft/s/s so that I could just give the
number in the "familiar" units and have it come out in the base units in
the code:
<pre>float m = 1, s = 1;<br>float ft = 0.3048 * m;<br>float g = 32.17 * ft/s/s; /* Earth gravity */</pre>
Wow. Now that gave me what I was looking for:
<ul>
  <li>The base units are explicitly declared</li>
  <li>The other units are defined in terms of the base units or other defined
units</li>
  <li>Values can be entered in familiar units with those units explicitly
given</li>
</ul>
As I began using this system, I discovered some other benefits. When
values were read in from the console or a file, the statements converting
them into internal program units were also explicit even though no numerical
constants were involved:
<pre>input "Distance in km:", distance<br>distance = distance * km</pre>
Also, when values needed to be printed, they often needed to be in something
other than internal units, and this style made that easy too:
<pre>print "Distance: "; distance / km; " km"</pre>
When you need a value in a particular unit, just divide it by that unit.
Using the units this way, it is clearer if you enclose the units in parenthesis
for compound units such as:
<pre>print "Speed: "; speed / (miles/hour); " mph"</pre>
This way, when you have units that use '/', you don't have to invert them.
Otherwise it would be:
<pre>print "Speed: "; speed / miles * hour; " mph"</pre>
and be less clear about what the units being printed were.
<h3>Other uses</h3>
Another reason to use unit conversions is to safeguard against future changes
in the code in places other than the input and output of values. If
you have a routine that is assuming the units of time is in seconds in order
to break it down into days, hours, minutes and seconds, it would break if
the time base unit was changed to milliseconds. A simple safeguard
would be using "<tt>time / seconds</tt>" rather than just "<tt>time</tt>".
Sure it's dividing by one, but it also documents what was otherwise an assumption.
If you have real run-time concerns, you might just use a comment to at least
remind yourself that it would need changing if the time base changed.
However, if the base time unit were seconds, then the value of <tt>seconds</tt>
is <tt>1.0</tt>, and if it is declared as a constant value, your compiler
might just take that division by 1 out in the optimization pass. This
same scheme of using the "divide by unity" conversions works well where you
have code that interfaces with other code. The input and output parameters
are just like numbers read or written to a file with respect to units.
So using units on the incoming numbers when storing them in your data structures
would be a very good use and explicitly document the units in the interface
code. Likewise for any return parameters. The return variable
should be loaded with an explicitly converted value for return, unless the
routine does not care what units the values are in (say a routine that just
scales a value). An example might be:<br>

<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function GroundDistance (PlanetRadius,
CentralAngle)</tt>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implicit none</tt></p>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include "units.fi"</tt></p>
  <p><tt>c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return:</tt></p>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; real GroundDistance</tt></p>
  <p><tt>c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inputs:</tt></p>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; real PlanetRadius, CentralAngle</tt>
  </p>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GroundDistance = PlanetRadius * (CentralAngle
/ radians)</tt></p>
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end</tt></p>
</blockquote>
The expression requires the angle to be in radians, so the conversion (<tt>/
radians</tt>) is given. However, the distance does not care, so the return
units for distance don't have to be converted, and can be returned as given.
<h3>Reality</h3>
Of course, setting this system up takes a bit of work. You need to establish
all of your base units and declare these to be unity, then declare all the
other units you are going to use. However, once you do this, you can
just use that file in all your other programs.
<p>In C, it makes a nice units.h file. In most languages, you can just
use an include statement. In Visual Basic, I believe you would just
have a .bas file with the declarations included in the project. Some
scripting languages should either have an include facility, or you might
be able to call a script that declares the values. This does mean that
you will have to implement it for each language you intend to use it with,
but that is to be expected.</p>
<p>There is the question of precision. It is true that:</p>
<pre>float g = 9.81;</pre>
and
<pre>float m = 1, s = 1;<br>float ft = 0.3048 * m;<br>float g = 32.17 * ft/s/s;</pre>
may not have the exact same values for g. This relies on having very
accurate values for your conversions and using double precision if possible.
Sometimes, you can express a conversion more accurately by other means:
<pre>float rad = 1;<br>float pi, deg;<br>pi = acos(-1.0);<br>deg = rad * 180.0 / pi;</pre>
rather than defining deg as:
<pre>deg = rad * 57.295779513082320876798154814105;</pre>
or typically something less precise. I've seen code where values were
repeatedly converted back and forth from degrees to radians multiple times
with different conversion constants.
<h3>The Next Level</h3>
<p>Just having some constants defined is pretty useful, but building on that
can create some even more useful subroutines. I have created a few
routines that help interface the units idea with the user and with input
and output files. The first is a primitive that simply takes a string
that contains the name of a unit and gives the numeric value for it.
It is called UnitValue.<br>
Of course, it's usefulness depends on what unit names it's taught to recognize.
</p>
<p>The next level that builds on UnitValue is UnitsValue. This takes
a string that contains compound units expressed like: <tt>km/s</tt>or <tt>foot*lbs</tt>
and resolves it to a single unit multiplier value. It can also parse
a single number in front of the units and multiply that by the resultant
units value. This gives you the number back in the base units.
The units can be separated from the number by a space, but multiple units
need to have a * or / between them. My current implementation doesn't
support power notation for something like <tt>cm^2</tt>, but it would be
easy to do by modifying the primitive UnitValue to recognize<tt>cm^2</tt>
and returnthe value <tt>cm*cm</tt>. However, this means you have to
define it for every unit and every power you want. Better to enhance
UnitsValue to do it.</p>
<p>UnitsConvert takes a number in base units and converts it to a number
in the units given by a string.</p>
<p>You could use this to let the user input a unit string so that you can
output values in those units along with the string to label them. I used
this to add units support to a program where the user gives the distance
units on the command line to tell the program that the input is in "feet"
(or whatever), and the program can convert the input.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
The concept is not really hard, it's not really exciting, and it's full potential
is not always immediately obvious - even to me. I only recently realized
that such a system could possibly have prevented the Mars Climate Orbiter
crash. Although that's unlikely since the problem was connecting two
different subsystems rather than two different parts of the same code.<br>
